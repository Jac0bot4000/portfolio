                <p>Through courses such as New Media Digital Survey I and II, I have gained an understanding of and 
                    appreciation for the graphic design principles. Additionally, these classes have taught me to use
                    the Adobe creative suite to its fullest potential, focussing specifically on Photoshop, Illustrator, 
                    and InDesign.<br><br>I have had the opportunity to apply these skills in professional settings, from digital displays that have
                    been run all around RIT's campus, to signage for RIT commencement, or physical print media that is permenantly 
                    installed at my home YMCA.
