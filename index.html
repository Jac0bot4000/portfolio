                <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>Through courses such as New Media Digital Survey I and II, I have gained an understanding of and 
                    appreciation for the graphic design principles. Additionally, these classes have taught me to use
                    the Adobe creative suite to its fullest potential, focussing specifically on Photoshop, Illustrator, 
                    and InDesign.<br><br>I have had the opportunity to apply these skills in professional settings, from digital displays that have
                    been run all around RIT's campus, to signage for RIT commencement, or physical print media that is permenantly 
                    installed at my home YMCA.

                <h2>Web Design</h2>
                <p>At RIT, I have taken both Web & Mobile Development I and II, as well as an Introduction to Database and Data Modeling; these classes
                    have taught me the foundations and uses of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Using these skills, I have worked on and developed
                    multiple websites including this portfolio site.<br><br>My focus in web development is the front end design and appearance; as such,
                    I have served as an information architect on a semester-long group project creating a site explaining the CRAP principles. For this, I
                    created high-fidelity wireframes and used them as a guide to style much of the content of the website. Despite my focus, I've also
                    coded plenty of server-side functionality, such as form validation and php scripting.

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Photography has always been more of a hobby of mine, where I have not recieved much professional training in the art; however, I still
                    have a collection of landscape and object photography that I have taken and edited myself.
